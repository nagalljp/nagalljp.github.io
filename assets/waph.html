I also
                became acquainted with “HTTP” responses and requests in Part_1. Additionally,
                in Part_1.2 I got to know, how to utilize the Telnet code to dispatch requests to
                a server and receive responses that confirm connections. This understanding was
                acquired through the utilization of Wireshark as a tool. Moving on to Part 2 I
                delved into web application programming using the Common Gateway Interface
                (CGI) which is instrumental in real-time web application development. In Part
                2.2 I created an HTML-formatted web application program.</li>

Starting with the HTML tags discussed in the lecture I further expanded my understanding of HTML and CSS by visiting the website [w3schools]. Throughout the lectures I delved into how jQuery simplifies JavaScript usage, how Ajax facilitates data retrieval from servers and how CSS can enhance web page styling. This knowledge allowed me to seamlessly integrate APIs into my HTML files.

This lab has two tasks with multiple sub-tasks with grade distribution as follows.

                In summary, the lab taught me about site scripting attacks, on web pages. These attacks come in levels ranging from level 0 to level 6. The approach for each level differs. To input the data an echo file is used, with methods such as GET, POST, forms, altering input script tags using image tags, as input, and utilizing onerror and onmouseover functions.</li>
